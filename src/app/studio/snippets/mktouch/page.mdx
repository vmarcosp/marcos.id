<div className="markdown-container">
# mktouch
As a Neovim user, I'm used to creating folders directly from my terminal instead of using
the editor or a GUI. Frequently, I need to touch a new file, like a component, but I don't have
the parent folders to place this new file in. So, my friend [@fdaciuk](https://twitter.com/fdaciuk) showed me this awesome shell script that 
  magically not just creates the file, but also the needed parent folders if they don't exist:

```sh
function mktouch () {
  for p in $@; do
    mkdir -p $(dirname "$p")
  done

  touch $@
}
```

## Usage

Just like `mkdir` but with super powers:

```
mktouch src/path/to/component/Component.js
```

</div>

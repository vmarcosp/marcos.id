# PNG to WebP

As a UI Engineer taking care of web performance is a daily task. With this in mind, a recurrent task in the projects I work on is to convert
`.png` files to `.webp`. For years I've tried a many tools, like [Convert IO](https://convertio.co/pt/png-webp/).

However, sometimes I needed to convert a lot of PNG files at the same time, and dragging and dropping them to an website, downloading and moving them to the project's folder
were quite time-consuming. So, at some point I came across [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp), which is a basically a CLI to convert
`.png` into `.webp` easily:

```sh
  cwebp -q 100 image.png -o image.webp
```

## The snippet

Okay, now we have a powerful CLI that does the heavy job for us, but it's still time-consuming run the command file-by-file, right? So, I ended up with
a shell function that converts all `.png` files within a folder into `.webp`:

```
function png2webp () {
  for file in *; do
      cwebp -q 100 "$file" -o "${file%.png}.webp"
  done
}
```

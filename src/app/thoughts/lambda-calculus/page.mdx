  # Lambda Calculus: What a JavaScript developer actually needs to know
    
  While lambda calculus is the foundation of functional programming, I wouldn't have the audacity to 
  explain it formally, nor attempt to summarize it in a few paragraphs of an article. However, there are some
  key aspects that you need to know before delving into functional programming concepts.

  In this article, I'll briefly explain the concept (spoiler: I'm not an expert) and navigate through some
  important parts that I find relevant to your journey in writing functional code in JavaScript.
  
  ## The history
  "Lambda calculus was introduced by mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of an investigation into the foundations of mathematics". 
  I think this doesn't say too much right? But I couldn't avoid mentioning. In summary, lambda calculus is a formal system to express computation
  by using functions.

  "It uses **function abstractions** and **application** using variable **binding** and **substitution**", it seems a bit noisy, right? Let's break down this statement:

  ### 1. Function abstraction
